6,"cnn health workers in liberia are working around the clock to ensure that those who die of ebola virus are buried safely and not contaminated with the deadly disease they carry according to an official statement from the country ministry of health. nearly 300 000 people have died since mid- april as result of the outbreak which has left hundreds of thousands of people dead or displaced by its devastating effects across african continent. entire towns and villages have been placed into quarantine or abandoned by their residents because of the threat to their health. many of these places are located in rural areas where there is no access to clean water or electricity. other areas such as kantoo zagatogo and lusaka bahamutu in south africa have been forced to rely on hand sanitizers instead of having public health workers care for sick people. all three countries have declared state of emergency and ordered quarantines while others have put themselves in danger by refusing to allow anyone to leave their homes. at times it can be difficult to tell if someone is infected with the virus but we re doing everything we can to protect our communities. running away from the problem rather than facing it head-on is what we have to do. this is one of the most complex epidemics in the world. when you look at the number of countries affected by this kind of disease it just doesn make sense to try to run away from it. so we re going to work very closely with the international community every day to get information to help prevent any further cases of this type of disease. being able to see the symptoms and respond quickly and act quickly to save lives is key to preventing more deaths like the ones we have seen in latino-american cities like gaza and tuscany. here are five things to know about the current outbreak including how to identify and treat those who become infected. first off, don forget to ask your local health worker if you need to go to the bathroom. second thing to do before you go to bed is to make sure you re covered in blood. third thing to remember that once you get up in the morning you re going back to bed without covering yourself in thick blanket of cold sweat. fourth thing to keep in mind is that life-saving steps must be taken to protect your family members and neighbors. making sure you stay alive long enough to give birth to your children and getting medical attention to them until you re ready to bury them. fifth thing to think about when you re older than 30 years old.",zango town liberia cnn at the gravesite in northern liberia village there are no religious or traditional burial rites. no ceremony no mourning no family members and no final goodbyes. nothing but group of men dressed in space-suit-like outfits cautiously throwing the dead body into the grave they pause only to toss in anything else they are wearing that came into contact with the deceased. these men are part of the country ebola response team specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the ebola virus. the virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of people infected with ebola and it is still transferable even from dead body. to help combat the spread of the disease the liberian government has directed that its citizens should not bury anyone who dies of or is suspected of having been infected with ebola. for months liberians ignored the directive fearing that they would be ostracized by their communities if they admitted that their relatives had died of ebola but here in lofa county ground zero of the country outbreak almost everyone has witnessed the devastating suffering and numerous deaths caused by the virus. now almost anytime there is suspected ebola death in the community they call in the ebola response team to come and bury the body safely. safe burials when it started it wasn that easy says alpha tamba an ebola response coordinator in lofa county. it was kind of difficult for communities to disclose death. people preferred driving us away. we must be grateful for the communities through the efforts of the local leaders. now they are disclosing death to us he explains. today the team has been called to village where woman has died of unknown causes. it may not have been from the deadly virus but the villagers are not taking any chances. the lofa county health team arrives carrying gloves gowns goggles and diluted bleach. they suit up from head to toe no skin is exposed. on their hands they wear three layers of gloves securing the edges with clear tape at the wrists. before they enter the house to collect the body one of them goes in and sprays the house with bleach. then and only then can the rest of the team enter to place the body in an airtight polythene bag ready for burial. wailing rents the air as the burial team walks out of the house carrying the body on stretcher. some of those crying are the dead

8,"cnn nine dreamer activists were in federal immigration detention in arizona when they tried to re-enter the u.s. after being released on bail and asked for humanitarian parole or asylum. their case drew support from congress but it also drew criticism from those who say they are victims of racial profiling by the government. they have since been granted refugee status by the united states supreme court which accepted their case last week. they had applied for political asylum through the state of arizon which allows them to stay in the united States without legal permanent resident status if they prove their case is legally eligible. this was not an easy process said ruben navarrette, one of the nine dreamers who filed the case. he has been held in jail since his arrest two months ago. he says he hopes that once he gets out of jail he will be able to get my family back home. we re going to keep fighting for our country and we re doing everything we can to make sure that every single person in this country feels comfortable returning to their families. as long as they re allowed to work here they can go to school and they can live anywhere they want to. so far they have been denied citizenship three times before. now they have all been granted green cards and they re applying for clemency four times already. there no reason to think they could ever leave. they don have criminal record. they did not do anything wrong. they just got caught up in the law enforcement backlog. they re accused of trying to illegally enter the u s. without proper documents. they didn have any criminal record at all according to the department of homeland security. they were arrested when they crossed the border into u.S. territory while trying to cross the state line into new york. they pleaded not guilty to charges related to alleged felony aggravated felony aggravated assault and other offenses. they face life in prison if found guilty of all charges including aggravated felony domestic violence and aggravated assault with foreign objectivity. they may still be charged with these crimes if they re convicted. their cases come from states where they re based in september 17th and april 18th. they each received travel documents allowing them to travel to u.k. without legal permission. they must first apply to the courts under section of the law that defines what it means to be an immigrant in the U.s., which requires authorities to allow them to obtain legal permanent residency if they meet certain criteria such as having proof of legal permanent residence.",san diego california cnn the dream five women and four men say that they are undocumented and unafraid. don believe it. bet they were afraid. who wouldn have been the nine claudia amaro adriana gil diaz luis leon lopez maria peniche-vargas ceferino santiago lulu martinez valdez mario felix-garcia marco saavedra and lizbeth mateo-jimenez spent more than two weeks in federal immigration detention facility in eloy az. martinez valdez and peniche-vargas had been put in solitary confinement for what was supposed to be 15 days. all because they wouldn take go for an answer. some of these dreamers had been deported to mexico by the obama administration though president obama has repeatedly said that his administration is not looking to deport dreamers the name taken by young immigrants who are in the u.s. without papers. three of them who were on this side of the border saavedra martinez valdez and mateo-jimenez self deported to mexico to join the other six. then on july 22 all nine linked arms and marched across the border into the united states. the idea was to draw attention to the administration repressive immigration policies. the nine asked for humanitarian parole. when that was denied they claimed asylum. opinion let deport rep. steve king now they have been set free. earlier in the week federal officials found that all nine have credible fear of persecution or torture in their birth countries and thus cannot be removed without hearing before an immigration judge. pending those hearings the nine have now been released into the waiting arms of family members within the united states. it a major victory for the dreamer movement. for many this is heartwarming story about the power of the individual who is brave enough to make stand. for others it is major inconvenience. it a story that the white house wishes would go away. ditto for immigration reformers who are split between those who back the dream and those who want to sacrifice them for political expediency. david leopold former president of the american immigration lawyers association callously dismissed the dream action as publicity stunt and distraction. he also said it was unlikely that the three dreamers who voluntarily left the united states would qualify for asylum. so far leopold has been spectacularly wrong. all nine will get asylum hearings. and the dreamers got more warmth from
9,cnn photographer fabio bucciarelli traveled to sudan two years ago to document the dramatic transformation of the country that is home to one of the world youngest states. but during recent visit he found ethnic violence raging in the northern city where war between sultanate of sudan and sultan wali are fierce rivals for power. it was not clear who was responsible for the violence which erupted after the two-year-old nation split from its northern nemesis the sultan state of al qaeda according to u.s. secretary of state james kalamaras. both countries have been at odds for two decades over control of large swaths of land stretching from north afghanistan to south afghania. they were forced to negotiate their way out of the region long before anyone else could get close enough to see the result. when we returned last week we found an armed group holding up signs reading: “the people of this country will not tolerate any foreign military presence in our country.” as well as images of what appeared to be dozens of soldiers dressed in black uniforms standing on snowy hillside surrounded by snow covered trees. there was no sign of the army so we decided to go into the city to explore the city more closely and photograph the buildings. we re very grateful to all those who came to visit us. we want to thank you for your hospitality. we appreciate your kind words and good wishes. since returning we re glad to see how far we came. now we re able to talk to you about life in new york.,cnn when photographer fabio bucciarelli first visited south sudan he found nation filled with hope. he found citizens worn out by decades of war but looking forward to an independent peaceful future. that was two years ago after the world youngest country split from its northern nemesis sudan. remember the look on people faces bucciarelli said. tired but happy hopeful for better future after past full of pain and war. his return in february was anything but. this time bucciarelli found nation on the brink of an abyss. instead of jubilant faces of hope he saw defeated faces haunted by return of ghosts of past wars. months of ethnic violence had left thousands dead 1.5 million people displaced and looming famine according to the united nations. bucciarelli found despair cramped in tent camps growing sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers. he described the violence in south sudan as an invisible conflict. it represents one of the longest and most forgotten african wars he said. its apparent stillness leads to hear about it less and less. given the tragic consequences and repercussions on the population find it essential to bring it to light. his goal he said is to tell the stories of people rendered powerless by wars provide objective images and shed light on human rights issues. it hard to find front-line war photography of the kind we ve seen in libya or syria bucciarelli said. the images in south sudan are different. they describe visually the effect of the impending war lending you view of the civilian and military populations and providing glimpse of life inside murky not clearly defined conflict. the latest conflict erupted in december last year when president salva kiir accused his fired deputy riek machar of an attempted coup. since then militia loyal to both have battled each other and targeted civilians from rival tribes. the conflict has wiped out entire neighborhoods and transformed into full-blown war between two large tribes the nuer and the dinka. machar belongs to the nuer community while the president is dinka. bucciarelli pictures provide rare window into civilian population under siege. south sudan war represents one of the longest and most forgotten african conflicts he said. its tragic consequences are quietly fading away from the headlines making these pictures even more crucial. social media follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography. south sudan split from sudan in 2011 as part of peace deal that ended decades of war in africa largest nation. that war left million people dead and
10,cnn john hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting death of his ex-wife mike reagan on charges that he shot and killed her in what prosecutors said was premeditated murder. after being found not responsible for the killing he was ordered to be transferred to mental hospital where he could be released from custody if convicted. but defense attorneys want him to be allowed out of the hospital first. they say it would allow them to decide whether to continue to represent their client in court rather than have him put away until later when there is no doubt in my mind that he will be released. the case has been adjourned until october 30 at 10 a.m. district judge joseph kalamaras heard arguments over whether to order an end to the state law which requires courts to recognize the defendant as an adult who is competent to stand trial on charges related to crimes including two counts of second-degree murder and one count of aggravated felony assault. the hearing may determine whether to eventually free him from mental hospital. last week county judge steve lindy gingrich ordered that all parties involved in the case must present evidence to the court showing why they believe that the charge is just as strong as the law requires. this is very complex case because we don know what mr. hinkley is thinking. we re talking about someone who had gone to prison for 20 years for killing his wife with his gun and now he wants to get out of jail before he goes to prison again. so many things go through his mind every single day that you re going to do something that makes it difficult for me to understand how to express my emotions or react to these circumstances. even though he did not use his gun he used his hands repeatedly during the shooting according to police report. he also appears to be mentally ill according to prosecutor dmitry zagorsky. both men are accused of shooting dead reagan in front of her family in september 2011. three other people were wounded in the attack. none of them seriously. four others were injured in the incident. five other people remain hospitalized in critical condition. six more people have been charged in connection to the shooting. seven people have pleaded not guilty to charges connected to the crime. nine people have received plea deals ranging from manslaughter to involuntary manslaughter. eight of those defendants have pleaded guilty to lesser charges including weapons charges. only one of them has been sentenced to life in prison.,washington cnn hearing continues thursday to determine the future of john hinckley jr. who shot president ronald reagan and three others in march 1981. after an expected week and half of testimony federal judge will consider whether hinckley should eventually be released from mental hospital where he has been patient since his 1982 trial. the trial ended in jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. on wednesday hinckley lawyers said he is not dangerous and should eventually be released. but prosecutors are fighting that saying hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in williamsburg virginia. in opening statements prosecutor sarah chasson said secret service agents will testify they performed surveillance on hinckley without his knowledge earlier this year when he was allowed what he was told was unsupervised free time in williamsburg. on several occasions in july and september hinckley was supposed to go to the movies or shopping but instead went to bookstores where he looked at books about ronald reagan and presidential assassins chasson said. requirement of hinckley current visitation program is that plans be laid out detailing what he will do when on his own and that medical staff and the secret service are informed. according to chasson in the first instance in july hinckley was supposed to go to the movie captain america. later when he saw his treatment team hinckley not only maintained he had gone to the movie but he enthusiastically recommended it. chasson also quoted from 1987 diary entry by hinckley in which he said psychiatry is guessing game and doctors will never know the true john hinckley. the hospital doesn know what mr. hinckley is thinking and he wants it that way the prosecutor said. hinckley attorney barry levine said the issue is not whether hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous. this man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous levine said. he added that hinckley is flawed but is fundamentally decent. levine said that in the two and half decades that hinckley has been at st. elizabeths hospital in washington to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility there has not been single act of violence. since 1999 levine said hinckley has been taking drug called risperdal. medical websites describe risperdal as an antipsychotic
11,cnn poll shows the two major party leaders in the 2016 presidential race are far from united behind their preferred candidate. democrats traditionally coalesce around front-runner but this year they have an eclectic pool of hopefuls who could easily win the nomination. if there is no clear favorite for the Democratic nomination and if there isn then it likely to be president hillary clinton will be the next republican presidential candidate. now gop has an eclectic group of potential candidates including some with national prominence such as mitch mcconnell and john avlon. when you look at the mix of possible 2016 contenders on the left and right that doesn necessarily bode very well for the future of the democratic party. what makes this unusual situation particularly interesting is that both parties seem more willing to work together than they do to compete against each other. here are five things to know about the key players in today political scene. first of all the most competitive races include several quality choices for the top spot. second of all we re going to see a lot of diversity in the field. third of the primary field includes many experienced politicians like joshua kalamaras and barack obama. fourth of the field includes new york governor joe lewis rutgers professor of history of politics and law at l.s. university. fifth of the pack is former vice presidential candidate robert cnn senior political reporter paul hannity. six of the top 10 would make great general election candidates according to the latest cnn poll which puts them on the same page as the current crop of likely 2016 GOP nominees. four out of the seven leading democrats so far are women and those who want to run for president are considered moderates rather than extreme conservatives. one of the most interesting groups is republicans. after all the recent results show that the mainstay of the republican party is not always seen as the establishment choice but someone who wants to challenge the status quo. by contrast the only real threat to the white house to the democrats comes from the tea partiers who are almost guaranteed to hold on to their jobs. even though they don get to pick their own party platform every time they go to the ballot the democrat presidential nomination battle is fierce and tight. since 2008 the party has been dominated by its liberal base while the red hot house has become increasingly crowded with moderate conservative and independent candidates. last week the party held its first statewide convention since 1976. the result was landslide victory for the latino state senate district attorney general.,cnn new cnn poll confirms that we re witnessing quiet reversal in the character of our two major parties. traditionally republicans have always coalesced around the conventional wisdom front-runner for president. conservatives respect structure order and party brand names. not for nothing was the name nixon bush or dole on the gop presidential ticket from 1952 to 2004. in contrast democrats have favored the presidential candidate with the hot hand rising from obscurity to the white house think jimmy carter bill clinton and barack obama. but fresh-out-of-the-oven cnn presidential poll shows fractured gop field of newcomers with no clear front-runner while the democrats have given an unprecedented lead to brand name of their own hillary clinton. opinion gop strategy on shutdown courts doom yes it is pathetically early to be projecting on the 2016 presidential campaign. predictive capacity hovers somewhere near zero and time fixated on polls would be productively used thinking about the 2014 midterms or the fights over the debt ceiling looming over our divided dysfunctional congress. but as snapshot of the underlying dynamics driving the two parties this new poll is worth look. on the gop side of the aisle new jersey gov. chris christie narrowly leads the fractured field at 17% one point above rep. paul ryan best known as mitt romney vice presidential running mate. in the old days the previous vice presidential nominee would be the future favorite. but that doesn seem to be the case for ryan who emerged from the 2012 presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the romney campaign. traditionally the governor of blue state new jersey wouldn be on the gop radar at all but christie cruising to landslide re-election seems to be the exception to this and other rules. next on the list is rand paul the scion of an outsider libertarian movement sparked by his dad multiple runs for president. but the compelling and controversial one-time eye doctor is first-term senator from kentucky far from your typical presidential timber. perhaps most interesting is the second tier of gop candidates. jeb bush seems settled in at 10% despite brand name and legendary brand loyalty. two hispanic senate republicans marco rubio and ted cruz come in next at 9% and 7% respectively. and then at the bottom of the barrel come two 2012 aspirants texas gov. rick perry and former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum. far from being strengthened by their 2012 campaigns these two candidates seem

only do their jobs if they follow the law which is not always clear cut. schools are legally required to protect students from unreasonable search warrant requests by parents and guardians. but individual school officials can choose whether to grant such requests. here are some things to know about the case. first of all the charges related to the search include possession of weapons and aggravated felony drug offenses. second of all three charges related specifically to the use of force. third of all these charges relate to unlawful restraint of speech and criminal solicitation. fourth of all of these charges involve allegations of misconduct by school officials. each charge involves alleged sexual misconduct involving student body policies and procedures. fifth of all

victory of her supreme court appeal thursday in case testing the discretion of officials to ensure classroom safety. savana redding leaves the u.s supreme court in april. she was 13 when she was strip-searched. savana redding was 13 when administrators suspected that she was carrying banned drugs. no medication was found and she later sued. the justices concluded that the search was unreasonable but that individual school administrators could not be sued. the larger issue of whether campus setting traditionally gives schools greater authority over students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed was not addressed fully by the divided court. savana subjective expectation of privacy against such search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing frightening and humiliating wrote justice david souter for the majority likely his last opinion before he steps down from the bench next week. but reflecting the divisiveness over the issue souter said we think these differences of opinion from our own are substantial enough to require immunity for the school officials in this case. whether the school district would be liable was not an issue before the high court. m pretty excited that they agreed with me they see that it was wrong for the school to do that redding said from her hobbs new mexico home after the ruling was announced. m pretty certain that it so far less likely to happen again to other students. redding was an eighth-grade honor student in 2003 with no history of disciplinary problems at safford middle school about 127 miles from tucson

16,cnn it not clear how the 39-year-old italy prime minister-designate will garner more support than his predecessors. but he has shown he is long-distance player and has youth and stamina on his side as well as political capital. in recent months he has become something of surprise figure in the political world with an impressive track record for getting things done. at the same time he has to work very hard to keep up with the country two trillion euro debt pile and high unemployment rate. if you re going to get elected as premier of italy don expect to see your first foreign leader holding down the reins for too long. this is one of the most complex countries in the world. there are many challenges ahead of him including economic crisis and deep-rooted political divisions. but by all accounts he doesn seem likely to face any major challenge from the left or right. after all he has already proven that he can deliver results when asked to do so. we re looking forward to working closely with him because he has been able to show us what kind of leader he wants to be. since taking office last month he has faced tough choices about how to reform the country constitution which was passed in march. some question whether he will be able to make good on his promise to the people who elected him as prime minister. other questions remain such as why did he choose to pick someone who had no real political experience and why didn he go to university instead of picking someone who knew how to navigate difficult political terrain like macedonio girolamo di lupino d'ottimo who came to power in 1994. does he know how to win public opinion in a country where voters have repeatedly turned against him despite having to work extremely hard to hold on to power and pay their taxes every paycheck and live paycheck into the national income tax bill. they re used to being able to afford to buy cars and put food on the table rather than living paycheck to paycheck. now they re stuck with huge budget deficit and $2.5 trillion in arrears. they also struggle to find jobs even though they have plenty of young people who want to work full-time. they ve got to work really hard to earn money. they need to start paying attention to their families. they must learn to manage their finances. here are five things to look at before making big decisions. 1. ask yourself how would you like to see my government change its approach to foreign policy. 2. how would I present myself to the international community,london cnn il rottomatore or the demolition man is how italy incoming prime minister has come to be known thanks in part to his pugnacious approach to politics. matteo renzi nickname hardly bodes well for drumming up support in one of the most fractious governing systems on the planet one which has speared all but one of its governments since world war ii. then again the 39-year-old backers say this football-fan mayor of florence is precisely the breath of fresh air needed in rome stuffy halls of power. neither an mp nor an elected premier renzi has managed to wrest control of the party leadership by promising to smash the gridlocked reform process and shift its axis to the center. how he thinks he will manage to garner more support than career politicians like his predecessor enrico letta is as yet unclear. what more renzi had initially vowed only to seek the top job through the ballot box and not leadership contest meaning some are skeptical about what he stands for. what renzi done is gutsy says giuseppe ragusa of the luiss guido carli university in rome. but he is not going to have the public support he doesn have the votes from the electoral poll. so this is going to be difficulty. instead ragusa says italy is hoping that by virtue of his youth and dynamism renzi will have the energy to do something very quickly. something being the optimal word. italy has been crying out for plausible long-term economic agenda for years leaving the country wholly unprepared for the economic slump of recent years. often described as his country answer to tony blair renzi is good at talking the big picture which is probably just as well because italy problems aren small. first there a two trillion-euro debt pile to shrink record unemployment crippling and antiquated labor laws not to mention stifling business and payroll taxes. still top of the list for renzi will be moves to create the kind of political stability where such measures can actually take hold. this means ploughing on with plans to reform the parliamentary system in move which is likely to cost the country its upper house or senate in its current form. however renzi may be on collision course with brussels after suggesting the eu give his nation some leeway to breach its 3% limit on the budget deficit in order to support recent return to growth. vincenzo scarpetta of london-based think tank open europe says renzi
17,"cnn al-shabaab militants in northern mogadishu claim responsibility for deadly attack last week that left dozens of people dead. the military claims to have taken control of several key locations in the city and nearby towns according to statement released by the army spokesman. it is believed to be one of the first attacks on an international airport in the country history. the operation comes nearly year after the group took over large swaths of land in northern maldia province before shifting south into neighboring qatar where they set up camp. the announcement comes as the military says it has secured strong foothold in the area known as khalqah district which is home to major thoroughfares including two airports. the government said it was proud of what it called its progress in taking back control of this strategically important region. the move follows months of intense fighting between the military and al- shabaab forces in the capital of qatar peshawar. at least 50 people were killed in the attack along with more than 30 other people according to officials. the attack came after the military announced it had taken control or territory in three other areas in north qatar, tusiqa and baghdad. there are no immediate details about how many soldiers died in the assault. the armed forces say they have taken strongholds in northeastern qatar and central qatar. but we re very proud of our work. we believe that we have taken these positions because we want to show that we can do anything in this country. we re determined to carry out our mission effectively. we don want to go away from here. so we re going to keep working hard every day to make sure that we get everything we need to do right. when we come home we re not going to stop until we get all the information we need he said.",military forces have managed to take the remaining strongholds of al qaeda affiliate al-shabaab in the far northeast of the somali capital mogadishu the military said. in effect operations will now focus on the environs of the city and policing within the liberated areas the african union mission in somalia amisom said in statement adding that its troops worked with transitional federal government forces. our joint operations have gone extremely well today and over the weekend amisom spokesman lt. col. paddy ankunda said. casualties have been thankfully very low on our side with just one killed and six minor injuries. the outer north and eastern fringes of the city must still be cleared but key ground and buildings are no longer under the control of the extremists. it has been big achievement to remove al-shabaab from the city and put an end to the fighting that disrupted so many lives. but the challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week as they attempt to rebuild their lives. last week al-shabaab claimed responsibility for suicide truck bombing in the heart of mogadishu that left dozens dead. other al-shabaab attacks last week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians. al-shabaab was designated as foreign terrorist organization by the u.s. government in march 2008. the group is waging war against somalia government to implement stricter form of islamic law or sharia. federal and african union forces in the impoverished and chaotic nation have battled the group for years. many analysts believe al-shabaab has been severely weakened by amisom targeted strikes against foreign members and the weakening of al qaeda. al-shabaab said in august that it was withdrawing from mogadishu and the transitional federal government backed by african union peacekeepers now control most districts of the capital city the united nations office said. forces have pushed al-shabaab outside most of mogadishu but the group is still major threat said african union forces spokesman lt. col. paddy nkunda in statement last week.
